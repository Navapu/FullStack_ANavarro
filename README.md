# Full Stack Learning Journey ðŸš€

This repository is part of my journey learning **Full Stack Development**, where I practice both **frontend** and **backend** skills. 
As I progress through the course, I implement small projects, experiments, and exercises to solidify my understanding.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Covered So Far

### Frontend
- **React.js**
  - Routing: (`Route`, `Routes`, `NavLink`, `useParams`, `useSearchParams`)
  - Hooks: `useState`, `useRef`, `useContext`
  - REST API integration using `fetch`
  - State and event management
  - Reusable components
  - Conditional rendering and dynamic data

### Backend
- **Express.js**
  - Basic route handling (`GET`)
  - Dynamic route parameters using `req.params`
